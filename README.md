## 📥 Download

**[⬇️ Click here to download SalesforceFileExtractor.exe](https://github.com/AndreaPari/salesforce-contentdocument-file-export/raw/master/SalesforceFileExtractor.exe)**

> **Note**: If your browser blocks the download or Windows Defender flags it, this is a false positive. Click "More info" → "Run anyway" to proceed.

## 🚀 Quick Start

2. **Run** `SalesforceFileExtractor.exe` (double-click)
3. **Choose** authentication method:
   - Username/Password (NOT TESTED)
   - Session ID (TESTED AND WORKS) - Recommended
4. **Enter** your Salesforce credentials
5. **Select** output directory for downloaded files
6. **Click** "Start Download"

## 📋 System Requirements

## 🔐 Authentication Methods

### Session ID (Recommended)
Use this method if you have an existing Salesforce session token. This method has been tested and works reliably.

### Username/Password
Use your Salesforce login credentials. **Note**: This method has not been tested.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Windows Defender blocks the file**: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
